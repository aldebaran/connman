Service		org.moblin.connman
Interface	org.moblin.connman.Manager
Object path	/

Methods		dict GetProperties()

			Returns all global system properties. See the
			properties section for available properties.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments

		void SetProperty(string name, variant value)

			Changes the value of the specified property. Only
			properties that are listed as read-write are
			changeable. On success a PropertyChanged signal
			will be emitted.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.InvalidProperty

		string GetState()

			Return global connection state of a system. The
			same value is return via the State property.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments

		object CreateProfile(string name)

			Create and add new profile with the specified
			identifier name.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments

		void RemoveProfile(object path)

			Remove profile with specified object path.

			It is not possible to remove the current active
			profile. To remove the active profile a different
			one must be selected via ActiveProfile property
			first.

			At minimum one profile must be available all the time.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments

		void RequestScan(string type)

			Request to trigger a scan for the specified
			technology. The empty string "" triggers scanning
			on all technologies.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments

		void EnableTechnology(string type)

			Enable specified type of technologies.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments

		void DisableTechnology(string type)

			Disable specified type of technologies.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments

		object ConnectService(dict network)

			Connect to a network specified by the given
			properties.

			For connecting to a hidden WiFi network for example
			it is required that Type = "wifi" and the SSID
			properties are provided.

			When successful this method will return object
			path of the service object.

			This method can also be used to connect to an
			already existing service. It works exactly the
			same as executing the Connect method from the
			service interface.

			This method call will only return in case of an
			error or when the service is fully connected. So
			setting a longer D-Bus timeout might be a really
			good idea.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments

		void RegisterAgent(object path)

			Register new agent for handling user requests.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments

		void UnregisterAgent(object path)

			Unregister an existing agent.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments

Signals		PropertyChanged(string name, variant value)

			This signal indicates a changed value of the given
			property.

		StateChanged(string state)

			This signal is similar to the PropertyChanged signal
			for the State property.

			It exists for application state only care about the
			current state and so can avoid to be woken up when
			other details changes.

Properties	string State [readonly]

			The global connection state of a system. Possible
			values are "online" if at least one connection exists
			and "offline" if no device is connected.

			In certain situations the state might change to
			the value "connected". This can only be seen if
			previously no connection was present.

		array{string} AvailableTechnologies [readonly]

			The list of available technologies. The strings
			are the same as the ones from the service types.

		array{string} EnabledTechnologies [readonly]

			The list of enabled technologies. The strings
			are the same as the ones from the service types.

		array{string} ConnectedTechnologies [readonly]

			The list of connected technologies. The strings
			are the same as the ones from the service type.

		string DefaultTechnology [readonly]

			The current connected technology which holds the
			default route.

		boolean OfflineMode [readwrite]

			The offline mode indicates the global setting for
			switching all radios on or off. Changing offline mode
			to true results in powering down all devices. When
			leaving offline mode the individual policy of each
			device decides to switch the radio back on or not.

			During offline mode, it is still possible to switch
			certain technologies manually back on. For example
			the limited usage of WiFi or Bluetooth devices might
			be allowed in some situations.

		object ActiveProfile [readwrite]

			Object path of the current active profile.

		array{object} Profiles [readonly]

			List of profile object paths.

		array{object} Devices [readonly]

			List of device object paths.

		array{object} Services [readonly]

			List of service object paths. The list is sorted
			internally to have the service with the default
			route always first and then the favorite services
			followed by scan results.

			This list represents the available services for the
			current selected profile. If the profile gets changed
			then this list will be updated.

			The same list is available via the profile object
			itself. It is just provided here for convenience of
			applications only dealing with the current active
			profile.

		array{object} Connections [readonly]

			List of active connection object paths.
