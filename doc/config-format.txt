Connman configuration file format
*********************************

Connman uses configuration files to provision existing services. Connman will
be looking for its configuration files at STORAGEDIR which by default points
to /var/lib/connman/. Configuration file names must not include other
characters than letters or numbers and must have a .config suffix.
Those configuration files are text files with a simple format and we typically
have one file per provisioned network.

If the config file is removed, then Connman tries to remove the
provisioned service. If individual service entry inside config is removed,
then the corresponding provisioned service is removed. If service
entry is changed, then corresponding service is removed and then
immediately re-provisioned.


Global entry [global]
=====================

These files can have an optional global entry describing the actual file.
The 2 allowed fields for that entry are:
- Name: Name of the network.
- Description: Description of the network.
- Protected: Configuration protection against being removed, modified or
overwritten by a Manager.ProvisionService() call. If unset, this value defaults
to TRUE, i.e. configs are protected by default.


Service entry [service_*]
=========================

Each provisioned service must start with the [service_*] tag. Replace * with
an identifier unique to the config file.

Allowed fields:
- Type: Service type. We currently only support wifi and ethernet.
- IPv4: The IPv4 address, netmask and gateway. Format of the entry
  is network/netmask/gateway. The mask length can be used instead
  of netmask.
  Example: 192.168.1.2/24/192.168.1.1
           192.168.200.100/255.255.255.0/192.168.200.1
- IPv6: The IPv6 address, prefix length and gateway. Format of the entry
  is network/prefixlen/gateway. For IPv6 addresses only prefix length is
  accepted.
  Example: 2001:db8::2/64/2001:db8::1
- IPv6.Privacy: IPv6 privacy option. Value can be either "disabled",
  "enabled" or "prefered". See use_tempaddr variable description in Linux
  kernel Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt file.
- MAC: MAC address of the interface where this setting should be applied.
  The MAC address is optional and if it is missing, then the first found
  interface is used. The byte values must have prefix 0 added,
  the bytes must be separated by ":" char and its length must be
  exactly 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 17 characters.
- Nameservers: Comma separated list of nameservers
- SearchDomains: Comma separated list of DNS search domains
- Timeservers: Comma separated list of timeservers
- Domain: Domain name to be used

If IPv4 address is missing then DHCP is used. If IPv6 address is missing,
then SLAAC or DHCPv6 is used.

The following options are valid if Type is "wifi"
- Name: A string representation of an 802.11 SSID. If the SSID field is
  present, the Name field is ignored.
- SSID: A hexadecimal representation of an 802.11 SSID. If the SSID field is
  omitted, the Name field is used instead.
- EAP: EAP type. We currently only support tls, ttls or peap.
- CACertFile: File path to CA certificate file (PEM/DER).
- ClientCertFile: File path to client certificate file (PEM/DER).
- PrivateKeyFile: File path to client private key file (PEM/DER/PFX).
- PrivateKeyPassphrase: Password/passphrase for private key file.
- PrivateKeyPassphraseType: We only support the fsid passphrase type for now.
  This is for private keys generated by using their own filesystem UUID as the
  passphrase. The PrivateKeyPassphrase field is ignored when this field is set
  to fsid.
- Identity: Identity string for EAP.
- Phase2: Phase2 (inner authentication with TLS tunnel) authentication method.
  Prefix the value with "EAP-" to indicate the usage of an EAP-based inner
  authentication method (should only be used with EAP = TTLS).
- Passphrase: RSN/WPA/WPA2 Passphrase
- Hidden: If set to true, then this AP is hidden. If missing or set to false,
  then AP is not hidden.


Example
=======

This is a configuration file for a network providing EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS and
EAP-PEAP services.
The respective SSIDs are tls_ssid, ttls_ssid and peap_ssid and the file name
is example.config.
Please note that the SSID entry is for hexadecimal encoded SSID (e.g. "SSID =
746c735f73736964"). If your SSID does not contain any exotic character then
you should use the Name entry instead (e.g. "Name = tls_ssid").
