Background
==========

- Priority scale: High, Medium and Low

- Complexity scale: C1, C2, C4 and C8.
   The complexity scale is exponential, with complexity 1 being the
   lowest complexity. Complexity is a function of both task 'complexity'
   and task 'scope'.

Core
====

- Session API implementation

   Priority: High
   Complexity: C4
   Owner: Daniel Wagner <daniel.wagner@bmw-carit.de>
   Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>

   The session API should provide a connection abstraction in order to
   prioritize applications network accesses, prevent or allow network
   and bearer roaming, or provide applications with a way to request
   for periodic network connections. On-demand connections will be
   implemented through this API as well.

- WiSPR support

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C4
   Owner: Marcel Holtmann <marcel@holtmann.org>

   Based on the portal detection parsing results, and provisioned
   credentials, ConnMan should be able to initiate a WiSPR authentication.


- DNS caching

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C4

   A simple initial implementation would see ConnMan's dnsproxy
   caching the DNS record based on their TTL.


- Power management

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C4
   Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>

   Implement a simple device pm hook that ConnMan's core code would
   use whenever it decides to put devices in power save mode. Although
   the kernel runtime power management code should take care of that,
   not all driver (especially WiFi ones) implement runtime PM hooks.


- IP ranges allocation and check

   Priority: High
   Complexity: C2

   For both tethering and private networks, but also to detect invalid
   static IP configurations, we need to have a core IP range layer
   that manages all currently used IP blocks.


- Personal firewall

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C8

   Extend the iptables code and provide a D-Bus API for personal firewalling.


- PACRunner extensions

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C4

   Support more URI schemes, support multiple connections, tighter
   security integration.



WiFi
====

- Ad-Hoc support

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C2
   Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>


- Fast Connect

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C4
   Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>


- EAP-AKA/SIM

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C2
   Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>

   This EAP is needed for SIM card based network authentication.
   ConnMan here plays a minor role: Once wpa_supplicant is set up for
   starting and EAP-AKA/SIM authentication, it will talk to a SIM card
   through its pcsc-lite API.


- EAP-FAST

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C1
   Owner: Henri Bragge <henri.bragge@ixonos.com>


- EAP-GTC

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C1
   Owner: Henri Bragge <henri.bragge@ixonos.com>


- WiFi p2p

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C2



Bluetooth
=========

- DUN client

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C4
   Owner: Mario Tokarz <mario.tokarz@bmw-carit.de>



Cellular
========


VPN
===

- l2tp support

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C2
   Owner: Mohamed Abbas <mohamed.abbas@intel.com>


- pptp support

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C2
   Owner: Mohamed Abbas <mohamed.abbas@intel.com>


- IPsec

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C4


- Split tunnelling

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C8
   Dependencies: Core:Private networks

   The current VPN support puts the VPN interface at the top of the
   service list, giving VPNs the default route. When doing split
   tunneling, the system routes packet to the VPN interface for
   private IPs, while going through the default interface for the rest
   of the traffic.
