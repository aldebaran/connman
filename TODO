Background
==========

- Priority scale: High, Medium and Low

- Complexity scale: C1, C2, C4 and C8.
   The complexity scale is exponential, with complexity 1 being the
   lowest complexity. Complexity is a function of both task 'complexity'
   and task 'scope'.

Core
====

- connman_element removal

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C8
   Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>


- IPv4LL

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C4
   Owner: Julien Massot <jmassot@aldebaran-robotics.com>

   The IPv4 Link Local support should be integrated into DHCP-lib.
   IPv4LL should be started when DHCP failed, and then DHCP should
   be scheduled for periodic trials.
   Also, there should be no default route going through an IPv4LL
   interface.


- VPNc

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C2


- Agent callbacks

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C2
   Owner: Patrik Flykt <patrik.flykt@nokia.com>

   Implement Agent API according to doc/agent-api.txt


- Moving DNS proxy code to ConnMan core

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C2

   Supporting DNS proxy or resolv.conf direct editing seems more than
   plenty as far as resolving is concerned. So the idea is to move the
   dnsproxy plugin code to ConnMan core and have an additional command
   line option in case one would like to stick with the current
   resolver.c code for editing resolv.conf.


- WiFi tethering
   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C4

   WiFi tethering should be done through an extended wpa_supplicant
   D-Bus API, as STA and AP modes are typically mutually exclusive.


- Session API implementation

   Priority: High
   Complexity: C4
   Owner: Daniel Wagner <daniel.wagner@bmw-carit.de>
   Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>

   The session API should provide a connection abstraction in order to
   prioritize applications network accesses, prevent or allow network
   and bearer roaming, or provide applications with a way to request
   for periodic network connections. On-demand connections will be
   implemented through this API as well.
   See http://www.mail-archive.com/connman@connman.net/msg01653.html


- Provisioning D-Bus API

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C2
   Owner: Lucio Maciel <lucio.maciel@hp.com>

   The current service provisioning lacks inotify support for adding
   new provision files on the fly, and a D-Bus interface for modifying
   existing ones.


- WiSPR support

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C4
   Owner: Marcel Holtmann <marcel@holtmann.org>

   Based on the portal detection parsing results, and provisioned
   credentials, ConnMan should be able to initiate a WiSPR authentication.


- IPv6 enhancements

   Priority: High
   Complexity: C8
   Owner: Jukka Rissanen <jukka.rissanen@nokia.com>

   Support IPv6 only networks so that system can go online even if
   there is no IPv4 address. Also support more than one IPv6 address
   in one device so that the addresses are reported correctly via
   dbus interface. The autoconf IPv6 addresses need also some tweaking
   so that system will go online properly.


WiFi
====

- WPS

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C2
   Dependencies: Core:Agent callbacks


- Ad-Hoc support

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C2
   Dependencies: Core:IPv4LL
   Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>


- Fast Connect

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C4
   Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>


- EAP-AKA/SIM

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C2
   Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>

   This EAP is needed for SIM card based network authentication.
   ConnMan here plays a minor role: Once wpa_supplicant is set up for
   starting and EAP-AKA/SIM authentication, it will talk to a SIM card
   through its pcsc-lite API.


- EAP-Fast

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C1


- EAP-GTC

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C1


- WiFi p2p

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C2


- WiFi CRDA setting through 3G country

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C2
   Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>

   Setting the 802.11 country based on the 3G MNC/MCC.


Bluetooth
=========

- DUN client

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C4


- DUN server

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C4
