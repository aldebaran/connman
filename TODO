Background
==========

- Priority scale: High, Medium and Low

- Complexity scale: C1, C2, C4 and C8.
   The complexity scale is exponential, with complexity 1 being the
   lowest complexity. Complexity is a function of both task 'complexity'
   and task 'scope'.

Core
====

- Session API implementation

   Priority: High
   Complexity: C4
   Owner: Daniel Wagner <daniel.wagner@bmw-carit.de>
   Owner: Patrik Flykt <patrik.flykt@linux.intel.com>

   The session API should provide a connection abstraction in order to
   prioritize applications network accesses, prevent or allow network
   and bearer roaming, or provide applications with a way to request
   for periodic network connections. On-demand connections will be
   implemented through this API as well.
   See http://www.mail-archive.com/connman@connman.net/msg01653.html


- Personal firewall

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C8
   Owner: Tomasz Bursztyka <tomasz.bursztyka@linux.intel.com>

   Discuss and implement a basic and safe firewalling strategy into
   Connman. Provide a D-Bus API for personal firewalling.


- PACRunner extensions

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C4

   Support more URI schemes, support multiple connections, tighter
   security integration.


- Favorite service migration removal

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C1
  When: 12/2012

  Remove service migration code that moves services from default.profile
  to the current directory-based structure.


WiFi
====

- EAP-AKA/SIM

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C2
   Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>

   This EAP is needed for SIM card based network authentication.
   ConnMan here plays a minor role: Once wpa_supplicant is set up for
   starting and EAP-AKA/SIM authentication, it will talk to a SIM card
   through its pcsc-lite API.


- EAP-FAST

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C1


- Wireless background scan

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C4
   Owner: Tomasz Bursztyka <tomasz.bursztyka@linux.intel.com>

   While connected ConnMan should offload the background scanning to
   wpa_supplicant. Wpa_supplicant allows for a fancy background scan
   which frequency increases after the current connection signal level
   drops below a defined threshold.
   We should also be able to have wpa_supplicant do the background
   scanning for us when we're not connected, if we have configured our
   favorite networks.


- WiFi p2p

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C2


- Previous WPS pin code sending

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2

  Provide previous WPS pin code in PreviousPassphrase field if WPS was used.


Bluetooth
=========


Cellular
========


VPN
===

- IPsec

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C4
   Owner: Jukka Rissanen <jukka.rissanen@linux.intel.com>


Tools
=====

- Command line tool

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C4
   Owner: Patrik Flykt <patrik.flykt@linux.intel.com>

   For platforms not running python, it could prove useful to provide them
   with a native single binary command line tool.


User Interface
==============

- GNOME3 UI

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C4
   Owner: Alok Barsode <alok.barsode@linux.intel.com>

   A GNOME3 shell user interface would make it easier for mainstream distros
   users to use ConnMan.
